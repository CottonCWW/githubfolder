        <strong>Ponyo </strong>(Japanese: 崖の上のポニョ, literally "Ponyo on the Cliff") is a 2008 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by <strong>Hayao Miyazaki</strong>, animated by Studio Ghibli for the Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DY Media Partners, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Mitsubishi, and distributed by Toho.

      <p class="intro2">
        The 5-year-old boy <strong>Sōsuke</strong> grew up in a small seaside town and lived on the cliff of a small village near the sea with his mother Lisa. As a captain, his father went to sea for years, leaving Sōsuke and his mother to live together. One day, Sōsuke picked up a waste glass bottle washed ashore by the waves. There was a trapped little goldfish in it. The little goldfish is <strong>Ponyo</strong>. She is the daughter of the Mermaid Queen. She was trapped in a glass bottle while sneaking out to play with jellyfish. Sōsuke took Ponyo back to his home and kept her in a plastic basin. Ponyo had a good time at Sōsuke's house. They liked each other. However, the happy days soon passed, and Ponyo's father Fujimoto took her back to the bottom of the sea. Fujimoto used to be a wizard, and later fell in love with the Queen of the Mermaid and became the owner of the sea. After returning home, Ponyo missed Sōsuke so much. She made a bold decision - she wanted to become a person and stay with Sōsuke. With the help of her sisters, Ponyo stole her father's magic weapon and swam to the human world. Unexpectedly, the water of life with dangerous magic was out of control. So, the sea rose and the storm  raged. The sisters turned into a group of giant fish and turned into waves to rush towards the seaside town. Ponyo didn't expect that her  wish would bring such a disaster. Sōsuke, who promised to protect Ponyo's family forever, was about to face new challenges.
